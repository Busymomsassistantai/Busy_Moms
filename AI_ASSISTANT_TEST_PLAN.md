---

## Known Limitations

1. **Multiple Results**: If multiple items match a search term, Sarah asks for clarification
2. **Date Parsing**: Natural language dates work (today, tomorrow, Friday) but complex expressions may require specific dates
3. **Time Zones**: All times are in the user's local timezone
4. **Voice Recognition**: Wake word detection requires clear audio in quiet environment
5. **Conflict Resolution**: For calendar conflicts, Sarah suggests alternatives but doesn't auto-reschedule

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Sarah doesn't respond to voice
**Solution:** Check microphone permissions, ensure browser supports WebRTC, try text mode

### Issue: Items not appearing in UI
**Solution:** Refresh the component, check database for record, verify user_id matches

### Issue: Ambiguous search results
**Solution:** Be more specific in commands (use full names, include dates)

### Issue: Calendar conflicts not detected
**Solution:** Ensure events have proper start_time and end_time values
