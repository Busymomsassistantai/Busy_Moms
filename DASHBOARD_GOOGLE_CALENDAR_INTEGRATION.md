# Dashboard Google Calendar Integration

## Overview
The Dashboard's "Today's Schedule" section now displays a unified view of both local events and Google Calendar events for the current day.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Fetching
- **Local Events**: Fetched from the `events` table in Supabase
- **Google Calendar Events**: Fetched via `googleCalendarService.getEvents()` for today
- **Sync Mappings**: Checked against `calendar_sync_mappings` table to avoid duplicates

### 2. Duplicate Prevention
Events that have been synced from Google Calendar to the local database are only shown once (as local events). The system:
- Loads all sync mappings for the user
- Creates a Set of synced Google event IDs
- Filters out Google Calendar events that already exist in the local database

### 3. Event Merging and Sorting
All events (local and Google) are:
- Merged into a single array
- Sorted by start time (all-day events first, then by time)
- Displayed in chronological order

### 4. Visual Differentiation

**Local Events:**
- White background with gray border
- Rose-colored icon and time
- Standard appearance

**Google Calendar Events:**
- Cyan/teal gradient background with cyan border
- Cyan-colored icon and time
- Google logo badge next to event title
- Clearly labeled with "Google" indicator

### 5. User Experience
- Events are clickable and navigate to the full Calendar view
- Loading states show spinner during data fetch
- Empty state shown when no events for today
- Graceful degradation if Google Calendar is not connected

## Technical Flow

```
1. User opens Dashboard
2. loadDashboardData() is called
3. Fetch local events from Supabase
4. Check if Google Calendar is connected
5. If connected:
   a. Load sync mappings
   b. Fetch Google Calendar events for today
   c. Filter out already-synced events
6. Merge local and Google events
7. Sort by time
8. Display with visual differentiation
```

## Database Tables Used
- `events` - Local calendar events
- `calendar_sync_mappings` - Tracks which Google events are synced
- `profiles` - User profile information
- `shopping_lists` - Shopping items (for task count)
- `reminders` - User reminders

## API Calls
- `googleCalendarService.isConnected()` - Check connection status
- `googleCalendarService.getEvents()` - Fetch Google Calendar events

## Benefits
1. **Unified View**: Users see all their events in one place
2. **No Duplicates**: Synced events only appear once
3. **Clear Source**: Visual indicators show event origin
4. **Consistent Design**: Matches Calendar component styling
5. **Responsive**: Works on mobile and desktop
